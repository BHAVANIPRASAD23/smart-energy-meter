Smart energymeter
–IoT-based Energy meter is used to measure Energy consumed by Industry or houses digitally and uploaded to cloud. It reduces the power thifting and it allows us to understand when the load demand is high and low so that we can reduce or increase production of power from that we can save energy
–we use Hall effect sensor(ACS712 - 20A Range Current Sensor Module) and Node Mcu microcontroller for this project
